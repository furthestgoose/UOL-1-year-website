# UOL-first-year-website
this is a website I made for one of the assignments I had to do at my first year at the university of leicester

It uses modern design features such as parallax scrolling and makes use of a chatbot to give the user basic information about the convention with the backend of the chatbot being a basic LLM from transformers.js
